### Source Authentication and Authorization

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` If your tap requires special access on the source system, or any special authentication requirements, provide those here.

## Usage

You can easily run `tap-pingdom` by itself or in a pipeline using [Meltano](https://meltano.com/).

### Executing the Tap Directly

```bash
tap-pingdom --version
tap-pingdom --help
tap-pingdom --config CONFIG --discover > ./catalog.json
```

## Developer Resources

- [ ] `Developer TODO:` As a first step, scan the entire project for the text "`TODO:`" and complete any recommended steps, deleting the "TODO" references once completed.

### Initialize your Development Environment

1. Install [`tox`](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/installation.html).
1. Install [`meltano`](https://docs.meltano.com/getting-started/installation).

### Running Integration Tests

Run integration tests:

```bash
tox -e 3.14
```

You can also test the `tap-pingdom` CLI interface directly:

```bash
uv run tap-pingdom --about --format=json
```

### Testing with [Meltano](https://www.meltano.com)

_**Note:** This tap will work in any Singer environment and does not require Meltano.
Examples here are for convenience and to streamline end-to-end orchestration scenarios._

Your project comes with a custom `meltano.yml` project file already created. Open the `meltano.yml` and follow any _"TODO"_ items listed in
the file.

The following steps assume you have Meltano 3.5+ installed. If you have an older version, please upgrade your Meltano installation.

1. Install all plugins

   ```bash
   meltano lock --update --all
   ```

1. Check that the extractor is working properly

   ```bash
   meltano invoke tap-pingdom --version
   ```

1. Execute an ELT pipeline

   ```bash
   meltano run tap-pingdom target-jsonl
   ```
